This is the repo to prepare to the ML4NLP1 Exam at UZH.
Autodiff is one of the main topics, so I decided to learn it based on the videos by Andrej Karpathy.
I will (hopefully) go though all his videos till my exam.

These are the most clear and comprehensive videos about the essential DL topics, I've ever found on YouTube.
Here's the link to YouTube[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ].
